# learning-kotlin

This repository contains my code snippets and notes while learning Kotlin.
The materials for learning are the 2 O'Reilly courses:

- [Introduction to Kotlin Programming](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/introduction-to-kotlin/9781491964125/)
- [Advanced Kotlin Programming](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/advanced-kotlin-programming/9781491964149/)

The concepts are grouped by the course chapters, and each chapter has
corresponding files placed in a package, which, in turn, is placed into the 
package of the corresponding course.
